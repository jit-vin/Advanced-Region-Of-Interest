# Advanced ROI (Region of Interest)
This project leverages the YOLOv5 pretrained model to implement region of interest (ROI) detection with customizable boundaries. 
It introduces a unique feature allowing users to define polygons as ROIs for precise object detection within specified areas. 
Moreover, it offers zone entry and exit detection functionality for enhanced video analytics, making it ideal for surveillance, traffic monitoring, and crowd management applications.
