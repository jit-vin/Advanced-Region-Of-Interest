## Performance Comparison

| Parameters                  | Basic Model      | ROI Model        |
|-----------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Total Frame                 | 2527             | 2527             |
| Total Time                  | 42.99 seconds    | 41.61 seconds    |
| Average Inference Time      | 0.0049           | 0.0049           |
| Average FPS                 | 61.7             | 66.6             |

Our study on Advanced Region of Interest Detection using the YOLO Model with Mouse Interaction and Polygon Area Function reveals an 8% increase in FPS with the ROI model compared to the basic model. Additionally, the ROI model demonstrates more efficient CPU, GPU, and resource utilization, highlighting its practical advantage in real-world scenarios
